# Book_notes
This is another practice project with following features:
- alows to submit information about books (cover, author, title, review, rating and date)
- shows the reviews (with other books details) and allows sorting book reviews based on rating and date
- it fetches book covers from an API based on the ISBN which is taken as input
- stores the data in PostgreSQL
- allows updating reviews

Project is not fully finished, frontend and ui in general could be further improved, also i may add some additional features (users, uploading own cover etc) 


- To run the project download the files and run npm i
- Credential files for database are not included on github so contact me to get full access
